    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>Music disc jockeys and other remix artists specialize in the layering of different songs and tracks to create
        popular remixes and to build 'hype' through music.</p>

    <p>While there are many songs that mix well together, many do not. Here lies the creative process. Artists take
        many technical factors into consideration when mixing several songs.</p>

    These include:
    <ul>
        <li>Tempo</li>
        <li>Key</li>
        <li>Chord Progression</li>
        <li>Genre</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To aid artists in their creation process, we are creating a tool that allows users to find songs based on
        these properties.</p>

    <h3>Usefulness</h3>
    <p>This application will enable artists to find music in a given key, tempo, and genre to mix well with an already
        existing project or idea. Through this we hope to facilitate the creative process.</p>
    <hX>There are several existing applications similar to ours:</hX>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <a href="https://tunebat.com/">Tunebat</a>
            <ul>
                <li>Allows users to search for songs to find bpm and key.</li>
                <li>Users can find recommended songs based on an inputted song.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/">Spotify</a>
            <ul>
                <li>Allows users to find recommended music based on current playlists, liked songs, or previously
                    listened to
                    music.</li>
                <li>Has an advanced API for searching music and facilitating the above bullet.</li>
                <li>Lacks features to find music based on key and tempo.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discz-discover-share-music/id1521888879">Discz</a>
            <ul>
                <li>Allows users to upload a current playlist and display song recommendedations based on playlist</li>
                <li>Users can swipe on recommended songs wether they like the song or not.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Our goal is to improve on these applications by generating a list of similar recommended songs that mix
            well (similar tempo, key, chord progression) with an inputted song. This list will be sorted based on latest
            popularity, and have options to listen to songs mixed automatically.</strong></p>
    <h3>Realness - Data</h3>
    <p>We will gather data from one or more of the following sources:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scraping data from Tunebat or Spotify using an API.</li>
        <li>The million song dataset found <a href='http://millionsongdataset.com/'>here</a> (published 2011).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Functions:</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Users can add songs and metadata information that are not currently in the database.</li>
            <li>Users can search by key, tempo, release year, and other properties to find recommended songs.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><strong>Advanced Functions</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Users can sort searched results by current song popularity. Popularity will be obtained from sites like
                spotify and apple music top charts.</li>
            <li>Users can auto generate playlists where songs auto fade in and fade out with each other.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
